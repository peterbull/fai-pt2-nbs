    "As I progress through Part 2 of the fastai course, I've discovered the value of occasionally retracing my steps to assess my grasp on the fundamental concepts. In my journey through Part 1, I recall Chapter 4 of the book being particularly daunting, as it covered a broad range of essential topics early on. However, this comprehensive approach was necessary to establish a strong foundation for everything I would subsequently learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever I revisit those earlier chapters and analyze the code line by line, I'm often pleasantly surprised by the level of intuition I've developed in certain areas. Simultaneously, I'm also confronted with aspects that still elude my immediate understanding. Engaging in quick drills to reinforce these concepts has proven to be an effective method for staying sharp and achieving complete comprehension, even if it may feel somewhat repetitive. It's like eating vegetables as a child â€“ you may not want to, but it's ultimately beneficial and necessary for growth. I believe that through a similar positive feedback loop, I will acquire a taste for this process and derive great rewards from it.\n",
